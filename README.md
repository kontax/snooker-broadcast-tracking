# snooker-broadcast-tracking

### AIM ###

College project - Using AI techniques to analyse and evaluate snooker broadcast videos.

### OBJECTIVES ###

* Perform a literary survey on the use of artificial intelligence in computer vision.
* Collect data to use in developing and evaluating a tracking engine.
* Develop and compare AI methods for detecting objects on screen.
* Develop and compare AI methods for tracking the movement of objects on screen in real time.
* Develop a snooker rules engine to allow the extraction of meaningful data from the vision algorithms. 
* Create a front-end and messaging service to allow the data from the algorithms to be parsed.
* Evaluate and analyse the results.
* Write the report.
