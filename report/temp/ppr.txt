Introduction

The main objective of this is to explore various computer vision techniques for real-time analysis of snooker matches. The idea came from work – I work in an online gambling company and it was mentioned that “in-running” betting models could not currently be created for snooker as there was no live data available. While the idea stemmed from work there are no commitments regarding output for work, and no deadlines other than those set by the university, all work is done entirely in my own time and without external resources.

In-running betting is defined as taking bets on a sporting event while it is currently live, for example offering odds on who's going to score next in a football match, or who will win the next game in tennis. In order to offer these odds to customers, quantitative analysts build models which try to offer the most compelling initial prices while still making a profit for the company, which can then be tweaked by any traders in real time (citation needed). In order to create these models a large amount of data is gathered and used to predict potential outputs and their likelihood. Once the models are created, a live stream of data is required to put the model to use. The aims of this project hope to cater to that need.

Aims and Objectives

The main aim of the project is as follows:
- To use artificial intelligence techniques to analyse and evaluate snooker broadcast videos, and to extract usable data from them.

Objectives:
- Literary Survey: A review of the image recognition techniques that have been used successfully (or otherwise) and if and how they may be applied to real-time processing and tracking.
- Data Collection: Collect enough video data of live matches to analyse and use in the methods specified.
- Compare Methods: Build some proof of concept algorithms using the data collected and analyse the results, ultimately choosing the most suitable method to implement in the final program.
- Data Context: Develop an engine which configures the rules for snooker so as the data can be contextualized within the program.
- Frontend Development: Create a messaging API to ultimately allow models to subscribe to, as well as a GUI for anyone who needs to view the output data.
- Evaluation and Analysis: Write up an evaluation outlining the solution built.
- Conclusion and future work.



Methods

From early beginnings where a professor in MIT postulated that it would take a few PhD students no longer than a summer to crack resulting in the Computer Vision Club (cite), to today where hundreds of levels deep neural networks are currently being employed using clusters of GPU's for massive parallelism (cite MS wired article), processing power is finally reaching a stage whereby computer vision (CV) is becoming mainstream (cite examples). This project will attempt to implement one of these techniques into a functional piece of software to allow information to be parsed from snooker matches.

The first stage necessary will be to collect data to train on. This will be in the form of good quality videos of snooker matches that have been broadcast and uploaded online. Ideally all videos will be of an HD 720p quality, although if time permits then using lower quality data will also be considered. A large amount of data will be necessary in order to train the models on, whether it be neural networks which take a large amount of training data (cite), or another feature detector such as SURF (cite) to test against.

Once the data has been collected, then basic CV methods will be designed as a proof of concept and tested for suitability. The accuracy of the PoC's will need to be established using analytical techniques such as (cite example), and ultimately the most performant algorithm will be implemented into a working piece of software. In order to draw context and semantic information out of matches, a rules engine will also need to be developed allowing the detection software to establish information about the current state of the match. This will involve creating a database containing the rules, as well as an API to allow other software to extract information from it. A Software Requirements System will be written prior to development in order to outline the required functionality of the algorithms, and then unit and integration tests will be written during development using a Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology (cite). If the method chosen is one which involves training, then an AWS cluster may be spun up, depending on the requirements of the training methods. This can be scripted using such tools as (cite).

The ultimate use of the application will come in the form of a messaging API which will allow other software to parse the information that the CV algorithm collates. It will be possible to plug into the information being gathered by the CV algorithm and evaluated within the rules engine, allowing the user to parse whatever data necesary to perform real-time analysis of the match. If time permits, then a GUI will be developed displaying the position of each snooker ball on the table. This is a secodary objective however, as the necessary functionality can be performed without any frontend.

Progress To Date

The first stage of the project was to perform a literary survey of CV and ANN's. To start with, a history of computer vision was reviewed, starting from 1963 where Roberts attempted to using CV techniques to detect 3D objects.
