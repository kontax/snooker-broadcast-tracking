Introduction

The main objective of this is to explore various computer vision techniques for real-time analysis of images. The idea came from work – I work in an online gambling company and it was mentioned that “in-running” model's could not be created for snooker as there was no data currently available. After reading around the subject somewhat I thought it might be possible to glean enough data from matches broadcast online or on TV using computer vision techniques to create the models necessary

Aim:
To use artificial intelligence techniques to analyse and evaluate snooker broadcast videos.

Objectives:
- Perform a literary survey on the use of artificial intelligence in computer vision.
- Collect data to use in developing and evaluating a tracking engine.
- Develop and compare AI methods for detecting objects on screen.
- Develop and compare AI methods for tracking the movement of objects on screen in real time.
- Develop a snooker rules engine to allow the extraction of meaningful data from the vision algorithms. 
- Create a front-end and messaging service to allow the data from the algorithms to be parsed.
- Evaluate and analyse the results.
- Write the report.
